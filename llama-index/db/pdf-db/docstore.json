To calculate pro\nrata costs, divide the annua l cost by 365 and multiply the result by the num ber of days you intend to\nstay in Australia.\n\u00a0\nLiving costs\n12-month living costs are for:\nstudents or guardians - AUD21,041\npartners coming with you - AUD7,362\na child coming with you - AUD3,152.\nFrom 1 October 2023, the 12-month living costs will increase to:\nstudents or guardians - AUD24,505\npartners coming with you - AUD8,574\na child coming with you - AUD3,670.\nCourse fees\nUse the \u0000rst 12 months of your course fees. If your course is 12 months or less, use the total cost.\nDeduct any costs you have already paid \u2013 you must provide evidence you have paid them, such as a\nreceipt or Con\u0000rmation of Enrolment.\nIf you are in Australia and your course has already started, calculate the course fee for 12 months\nstarting on the date you lodge your application.\nExample 1: your course fee is AUD50,000 for 3 years. The fee for 12 months is the total course\ncost divided by the num ber of years you will be studying. AUD50,000 divided by 3 years =\nAUD16,666, less any amount you have already paid if relevant.\nExample 2: your course fee is AUD15,000 for 10 months and you have already paid AUD5,000.\nDeduct the amount you have already paid from the total amount. AUD15,000 - AUD5,000 =\nAUD10,000.\nExample 3: your course fee is AUD20,000 for 18 months. The fee for 12 months is the total\ndivided by the total num ber of months, then multiplied by 12. (AUD20,000/18) x 12 = AUD13,333.\nDeduct any costs you have already paid.\nSchooling costs\nIf you are including any school-age children in your application, add schooling costs of at least\nAUD8,296 per year for each child. Costs vary between states, territories and schools in Australia. You\nare responsible for \u0000nding out how much the child\u2019s schooling will cost.\nFrom 1 October 2023, if you are including any school-age children in your application, add schooling\ncosts of at least AUD9,661 per year for each child.\nYou don\u2019t have to provide evidence of schooling costs if you:\nare a PhD student and have enrolled your child in an Australian government school where the fees\nhave been waived, or\nhave received an Australian Commonwealth Government scholarship, including Foreign Affairs\nand Defence sponsored students, and have enrolled your child in an Australian government\nschool where the fees have been waived.\nYou must provide evidence the child is enrolled.",
